# Recipe Tool

A tool for building shopping lists.

Nice features:
Ingredients are grouped by their area in a shop.
It's designed so you can easily specify large multiples of each recipe, in case you want to prepare for self-inflicted societal collapse.

## How to run:

Run the main class, listing each recipe and, optionally, how many multiples of it you need:

chickpea_curry*12 breakfast*84 chilli*12 aubergine_casserole*12 tofu_noodle_soup*12 lentil_bolognese*12 seeded_wholemeal_bread*36 saag_tofu*7

or:
regular_items tofu_noodle_soup burgers stir_fry simple_pinto_wraps beetroot_soup leek_potato_soup fishcakes_chips jackets_with_beans pancakes_with_lentils quiche black_bean_burritos

## TODO:
add ingredients so they can be referred to by reference rather than a string
we then add info for how long they'll last?
we then can order meals by how long the ingredients last?
we can then add nutritional info?
